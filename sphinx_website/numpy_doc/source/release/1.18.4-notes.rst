NumPy 1.18.4 Release Notes
==========================

This is the last planned release in the 1.18.x series. It reverts the
``bool("0")`` behavior introduced in 1.18.3 and fixes a bug in
``Generator.integers``. There is also a link to a new troubleshooting section
in the documentation included in the error message emitted when numpy import
fails.

The Python versions supported in this release are 3.5-3.8. Downstream
developers should use Cython >= 0.29.15 for Python 3.8 support and
OpenBLAS >= 3.7 to avoid errors on the Skylake architecture.
