NumPy 1.21.6 Release Notes
==========================

NumPy 1.21.6 is a very small release that achieves two things:

- Backs out the mistaken backport of C++ code into 1.21.5.
- Provides a 32 bit Windows wheel for Python 3.10.

The provision of the 32 bit wheel is intended to make life easier
for oldest-supported-numpy.
