# Roadmap

## In progress and will be released in the near future
- Differentiable physically tactile sensor
- Differentiable rigid body simulation pipeline
- parallelized rendering
- A comprehensive generative framework
    - human motion
    - scene
    - facial expression
    - robot policy (manipulation + locomotion)
- Boundless MPM simulation for large-scale environment
- Faster rigid body compilation

## Wanted feature, but not currently working on (Contributions needed!)
- Viewer and headless rendering on windows
- An interactive GUI system
- Support for more MPM-based material models
- More sensor types
