# ðŸ’¡ What is Genesis

Genesis is a physical platform designed for general purpose *Robotics/Embodied AI/Physical AI* applications. It is simultaneously multiple things:
1. A **universal physics engine** re-built from the ground up, capable of simulating a wide range of materials and physical phenomena.
2. A **lightweight**, **ultra-fast**, **pythonic**, and **user-friendly** robotics simulation platform.
3. A powerful and fast **photo-realistic rendering system**.
3. A **generative data engine** that transforms user-prompted natural language description into various modalities of data.


Powered by a universal physics engine re-designed and re-built from the ground up, Genesis integrates various physics solvers and their coupling into a unified framework. This core physics engine is further enhanced by a generative agent framework that operates at an upper level, aiming towards fully **automated data generation** for robotics and beyond.

Genesis is built and continuously evolves with the following ***long-term missions***:
1. **Lowering the barrier** to using physics simulations and making robotics research accessible to everyone. (See our [manifesto](our_manifesto.md) here)
2. **Unifying a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art physics solvers** into a single framework, allowing re-creating the whole physical world in a virtual realm with the highest possible physical, visual and sensory fidelity, using the most up-to-date simulation techniques.
3. **Minimizing human effort** in collecting and generating data for robotics and other domains, letting the data flywheel spin on its own.
