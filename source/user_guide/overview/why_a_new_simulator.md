# 🧬 Why A New Physics Simulator
Compared to prior simulation platforms, here we highlight several key features of Genesis:
- 🐍 **100% Python**, both front-end interface and back-end physics engine, all natively developped in python.
- 👶 **Effortless installation** and **extremely simple** and **user-friendly** API design.
- 🚀 **Parallelized simulation** with ***unprecedented speed***: Genesis is the **world's fastest physics engine**, delivering simulation speeds up to ***20~50x*** (yes, this is a bit sci-fi) faster than existing *GPU-accelerated* robotic simulators (Isaac Gym/Sim/Lab, Mujoco MJX, etc), ***without any compromise*** on simulation accuracy and fidelity.
- 💥 A **unified** framework that supports various state-of-the-art physics solvers, modeling **a vast range of materials** and physical phenomena.
- 📸 Fast and photo-realistic rendering.
- ☝🏻 Physically-accurate and differentiable **tactile sensor**.
- 🌌 Native support for ***[Generative Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10455)***, allowing **language-prompted data generation** of various modalities: *interactive scene*, *task*, *reward*, *assets*, *character motion*, *policy*, *trajectory*, *camera motion*, *(physically-accurate) videos*, and more.
