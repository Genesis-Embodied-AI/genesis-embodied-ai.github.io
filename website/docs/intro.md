# What is Genesis

## Overview

Genesis is a physical world designed for general purpose embodied AI applications. It is empowered by a **universal physics engine** re-built from ground up that is capable of simulating a wide range of materials and physical phenomena, and a upper level generative agent framework that aiming towards fully **automated data generation** for robotics and other applications.

## Why another robotics simulator?
Compared to prior simulation platforms, here we highlight several key features of Genesis:
- 👶 100% Python. **Effortless installation** and extremely **intuitive and simple API** design.
- 🚀 **World's fastest** physics engine, achieving up to **20x** simulation speed compared to existing GPU-accelerated robotic simulators (Isaac Gym/Sim/Lab, Mujoco MJX, etc).
- 💥 A **unified** framework supporting various state-of-the-art physics solvers for modelling **a vast range of materials** and physical phenomena.
- 📸 Fast and photo-realistic rendering
- 🤏 Physically-accurate and differentiable **tactile sensor**
- 🌌 Native support for [Generative Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10455), allowing **language-prompted data generation** for various applications (scene, task, reward, assets, policy, trajectory, etc.)
